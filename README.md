# Tune-a

## A discord music bot made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), for Hack the North 2021.

### Instructions:

To run the bot, first clone the repository. Then, copy `config_example.py` into a new file called `config.py`. Now fill it in with your bot's token and the prefix you want to use.

You will have to use pip to install the `discord.py` library and the voice packages by running these commands:

`pip install discord.py`

`pip install discord.py[voice]`
